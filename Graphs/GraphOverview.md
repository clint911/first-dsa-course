#A Graph

A series of nodes with some amount of connections
```
Cycle: When you start at Node(X), follow the links and end back at Node(X)
```
```
cyclic graph : graph containing no nodes
```
```
Connected: Every node has path to another node
```
```
Directed: When there is a direction to the connections( think of sth like twitter )
```
```
undirected: not directed(think of sth like facebook)
```
```
weighted: The edges have a weight associated with them, think Maps
```
```
Dag: Directed, acyclic graph
```
Vertex: Node
edge: connections or lines connecting the Vertex
